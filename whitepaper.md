### Executive Summary

As digital transformation accelerates across sectors, mission-driven organizations such as nonprofits, healthcare institutions, and educational agencies face increasing cybersecurity challenges without proportionate resources. Traditional perimeter-based security models are inadequate in today’s distributed cloud environments. The Adaptive Zero Trust Framework (AZTF), designed by Saugat Sthapit, addresses this urgent need by delivering a cost-effective, Microsoft-native security architecture tailored for scalability, regulatory compliance, and operational agility.

Actively implemented by the **Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)** and **FHI360**, AZTF goes beyond textbook Zero Trust implementations. It introduces dynamic risk evaluation, automated identity governance, and a hub-and-spoke segmentation strategy that meets compliance requirements while reducing cloud spending and incidents by over 60% in some cases. This whitepaper presents the architecture, benefits, use cases, and future roadmap of AZTF as a nationally scalable solution.

### 1. Introduction and Problem Statement

Nonprofits, healthcare providers, and educational institutions are custodians of sensitive personal data and intellectual property, yet they often operate under constrained IT budgets and resource gaps. The rise in cloud adoption, remote access, and sophisticated attacks has made it imperative for these organizations to adopt a **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)** that is lightweight, adaptive, and integrable into their cloud-first strategies.

However, conventional Zero Trust implementations often require significant capital and third-party dependencies. These models are not always feasible for resource-constrained entities. There is a need for a framework that:

* Utilizes **cloud-native tools** to reduce vendor lock-in.
* Enables **granular access control** across dynamic, multi-tenant environments.
* Enforces **data governance** and compliance (HIPAA, FERPA, NIST, etc.).
* Offers **modular, replicable deployment** models.

AZTF is the first known Zero Trust framework built specifically with these conditions in mind.

### 2. AZTF Overview and Core Architecture

AZTF is built on Microsoft Azure’s native capabilities including:

* **Azure Entra ID** for identity access and governance.
* **Microsoft Sentinel** for SIEM and automated threat detection.
* **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** for continuous posture monitoring.
* **Azure Policy and Blueprints** for infrastructure as code (IaC) governance.
* **Microsoft Purview** for data classification and leakage prevention.

#### Core Components:

* **Hub-and-Spoke Network Segmentation**: Centralized control via a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) in the hub, with decentralized spoke environments for isolation.
* **Identity-Centric Design**: Role-based, just-in-time access using Entra PIM.
* **Automated Compliance**: Continuous evaluation against CIS/Microsoft benchmarks.
* **Zero Trust for AI Workloads**: LLM sandboxing, API security, and GitOps.

#### Strategic Goals:

* Migrate 100% to SaaS-based platforms by 2026.
* Maintain over 80% compliance score.
* Achieve full AI and data pipeline protection within the Zero Trust boundary.

### 3. Case Study: Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)

SPLC serves a national mission with high public visibility and a wide array of cloud resources. AZTF was deployed in phases starting August 2024:

* **IAM and Network Hardening**: Entra ID used for conditional access, MFA, and role enforcement. Network policies segmented high-sensitivity workloads.
* **Incident Reduction**: Within three months, SPLC observed a 60% decrease in unauthorized access attempts and a 70% drop in reported security incidents.
* **Compliance Jump**: Cloud compliance score rose from below 40% to 60%+.
* **Financial Impact**: Over \$30,000 in annual savings, redirected to investigative programs.

> *"AZTF has transformed our posture from reactive to proactive. It’s not just a framework—it’s a movement."*  — SPLC IT Director

SPLC’s IT roadmap includes:

* Migration of hybrid identity systems to full Entra.
* Expansion of Sentinel playbooks to detect AI threats.
* Onboarding of privacy auditing via Microsoft Purview.

### 4. Case Study: FHI360 (Healthcare Application)

FHI360 operates globally, handling protected health and program data. AZTF was adapted to meet international compliance and health sector standards:

* **Hub-and-Spoke Network Topology**: NVA-enabled centralized control, each subnet secured by role and workload.
* **Health Data Security**: Azure Purview used for classifying protected health info (PHI), with auto-remediation rules applied.
* **Compliance and Resilience**: Ensured alignment with HIPAA, GDPR, and other global frameworks.

> *"AZTF has allowed us to secure health program data in multi-region deployments while ensuring compliance with global standards."* — FHI360 Security Lead

FHI360 will be using AZTF to build:

* Secure collaborative research environments.
* AI-driven public health dashboards with built-in security.

### 5. Sector Use Cases & AZTF Expansion

#### Education

* **Student Record Protection**: FERPA-aligned access to academic and financial records.
* **Remote Learning Security**: Conditional access policies for devices and locations.
* **Malware & Phishing Defense**: Microsoft Defender integration.

#### Healthcare

* **PHI Protection**: Full data lineage mapping with Microsoft Purview.
* **Ransomware Resistance**: Network segmentation and behavioral analytics.
* **Operational Continuity**: Sentinel playbooks for automatic response.

#### Government and Advocacy

* **Policy-Driven Access**: Role-based access to public reports and legal documents.
* **Audit Trails**: Immutable logs for investigations.

### 6. AI & LLM Security: The Next Frontier

AZTF is evolving to meet the security needs of LLM (Large Language Model) and AI environments:

* **Zero Trust AI Sandbox**: Isolated environment for training/testing models.
* **Secure API Gateway**: Azure API Management enforcing throttling, OAuth 2.0.
* **DevSecOps Pipelines**: Azure DevOps + GitHub Advanced Security.
* **AI Threat Detection Playbooks**: Detect prompt injection, data leakage, misuse.
* **Governance & Auditing**: Usage tracking and access logs for model interactions.

These additions allow AZTF to extend into AI-heavy R\&D and data science environments, ensuring the same Zero Trust principles apply across the data lifecycle.

### 7. Key Outcomes and Metrics

| Metric                       | SPLC Result | FHI360 Result |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Unauthorized Access Attempts | -60%        | -55%          |
| Security Incident Volume     | -70%        | -65%          |
